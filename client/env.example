# Image Search API Configuration
# Get your free API keys from:
# - Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/developers (may take 5-10 days for approval)
# - Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/ (usually instant approval)

# Primary image search (recommended)

# Backup image search (faster approval)

# Note: If no API keys are configured, the app will use built-in stock images
# as fallback for playlist covers.
