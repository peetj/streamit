## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL
- FFmpeg (for audio processing)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd streamit
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database and JWT settings
   ```

4. **Set up database**
   ```bash
   # Create PostgreSQL database
   createdb streamflow
   
   # Run migrations
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. **Start the backend**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your API keys
   ```

3. **Set up API keys**

   **Image Search APIs (choose one or both):**
   
   **Option 1: Unsplash API (Primary - Higher Quality)**
   - Go to [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
   - Create an account and register your application
   - Get your free API key (may take 5-10 days for approval)
   - Add it to `client/.env.local`:
     ```
     VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key_here
     ```

   **Option 2: Flickr API (Backup - Faster Approval)**
   - Go to [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
   - Create an account and get your API key (usually instant approval)
   - Add it to `client/.env.local`:
     ```
     VITE_FLICKR_API_KEY=your_flickr_api_key_here
     ```

   **Note:** You can use both APIs - the app will try Unsplash first, then Flickr as backup.

4. **Start the frontend**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Keys Setup

### Image Search APIs

The app uses image search APIs for playlist cover images. You can use either or both APIs:

#### Option 1: Unsplash API (Primary - Higher Quality)

1. **Get a free API key:**
   - Visit [https://unsplash.com/developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Click "New Application"
   - Fill in the form:
     - Application name: "StreamFlow"
     - Description: "Music streaming app with playlist cover image search"
     - What are you building?: "A music streaming application that allows users to search for playlist cover images"
     - Will your app be commercial?: "No" (for development)
   - **Note:** Approval may take 5-10 days

2. **Add the key to your environment:**
   ```bash
   # In client/.env.local
   VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

#### Option 2: Flickr API (Backup - Faster Approval)

1. **Get a free API key:**
   - Visit [https://www.flickr.com/services/api/](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Click "Get an API key"
   - Fill in the form (usually instant approval)

2. **Add the key to your environment:**
   ```bash
   # In client/.env.local
   VITE_FLICKR_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

#### Using Both APIs

You can use both APIs for maximum reliability:
- The app will try **Unsplash first** (higher quality images)
- If Unsplash fails or has no results, it will try **Flickr**
- If both fail, it falls back to public image search

**Note:** If no API keys are provided, the app will fall back to public image search, but results may be less reliable.

## Usage
